            <ol>
            <li> Wash urad dal once and soak in water for at least 4 hours. Wash idli rice (parboiled rice) 2 - 3 times and soak rice and fenugreek seeds together in water for at least 4 hours.  
</li><li> After four hours discard the water from soaked urad dal and add the urad dal in a Blendtec jar. Add cold water little by little and grind it to a smooth batter. Choose batter option and grind for 3 - 4 times until the batter is smooth and fluffy. Transfer the batter to a wide bowl and set aside until needed. 
</li><li> Strain and discard the water from soaked rice and add rice to a blendtec jar. Grind the rice to a smooth batter (little coarse batter is fine) by adding cold water little by little. Choose batter option for 2 - 3 times and grind until smooth. Transfer the rice batter to a wide bowl with urad dal batter, add salt and mix well with hand.
