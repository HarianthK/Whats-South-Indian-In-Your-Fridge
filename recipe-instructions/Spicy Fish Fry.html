            <ol>
            <li> For marinade: In a bowl add red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt and mix well. Add lemon juice and mix well. Add water little by little and make a smooth paste. 
</li><li> Cut the tilapia fillets into small pieces and apply the marinade evenly on the fish. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. 
</li><li> In a separate bowl add corn flour, water and make a thin batter.  
</li><li> Heat oil in a pan and dip the marinated fish one by one in the batter and place in the hot oil carefully. Fry until the bottom side of the fish becomes crispy. Flip gently and fry on the other side until crispy. 
</li><li> Line a plate with paper towel. Remove the fried fish from the oil and place on the paper towel-lined plate (this helps to absorb the excess oil from fish). Garnish with sliced onion and lemon if desired and serve.
