        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
            Marinate the mutton with all the spices at least 8 hours to 12 hours in advance. If you are in a hurry you can also marinate for 1 hour but the longer your marinate, the flavor gets it and the meat becomes tender. (If you are making biryani for dinner, marinate in the morning and if you are making for the afternoon, marinate the previous night and place in the refrigerator.)
Fried Onions makes the biryani moist. You can either use store-bought or homemade.
Rinse and soak the rice for about an hour in cold water. This separates the rice and makes it fluffier. 
Gather the ingredients (Start doing this when the rice is soaking)
Start making Biryani: When the rice and meat are cooking, chop the herbs.
<br>
1st Step: Fry the cashews and onions. Drain and keep aside
<br>
2nd Step: Add marinated meat let it cook to almost 75% done.
<br>
3rd Step: Bring a big pot of water to a boil, season with salt and spices, and cook the rice to 50% doneness. Taste and adjust the flavor of the water as needed. Salt should be slightly more than what you normally have. Drain and keep aside.
<br>
4th step: Cook the mutton till you see an oil layer on top.
<br>
5th Step: Add 1/2 of the cooked rice and half of the fried onions + coriander leaves + mint leaves. Add the remaining rice and fried onions + coriander leaves + mint leaves + 2 green chilly. sprinkle reserved rice water on top followed by saffron milk. Sprinkle a few drops of food color if using.
Add a tablespoon of ghee and fried cashews.
<br>
6th Step: There are three ways you can cover. 1. With an aluminum foil: Place an aluminum foil on top and slightly seal and place a lid on top. 2. Seal with any kind of dough available. 3. Place the lid and keep something heavy on the top so that the steam does not escape.
<br>
7th Step: Place a girdle or pan on the stove and transfer the biryani pot on top. Reduce the heat to minimum and let it cook for 40 to 50 minutes.
<br>
Step 8: To check for doneness, open the lid and slide a laddle along the side of the pan and scoop out the meat. If there is no water content and the mutton is tender, it means the biriyani is ready.</ol>
